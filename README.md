# Hello and Welcome
To my showcase!  Here you will find the full code for my personal showcase, and what I believe to be my best
coding.  As I continue to learn, this project will (ideally) continually be updated with different tricks and
solutions I find along the way.  Expect to see many commits of varying quality from start to finish.
